- Function added, to add to the functions we already had such as add, substract, multiply and divide, We decided to add the square root and the power mathematic operators. We added both of them even if it was asked to add only one because we felt like those 2 operators are important on a calculator.
- We also added 5 new bitwise operators, and another square root for the second value.
